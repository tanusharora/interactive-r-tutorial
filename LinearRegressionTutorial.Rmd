```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(learnr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# Load tested function from R/ directory
# This function has been unit-tested with testthat (see tests/testthat/)
source("R/calc_regression_summary.R")
```

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to fit a linear regression model using R. We'll work with the built-in `mtcars` dataset and interpret the model results.

### Fit a model below (Exercise 1)
```{r fit-model, exercise=TRUE}
# Fit a linear model using lm()
# Predict mpg based on wt
# Hint: use lm(y ~ x, data = ...)
# lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
# We'll use the tested, modular function instead of raw lm()
# This ensures consistent output and leverages reusable, validated code
calc_regression_summary(mtcars, mpg ~ wt)

```


---

### Visualize Results (Exercise 2)

### Plotting the model
```{r plot-model, exercise=TRUE}
# Use plot() or ggplot2 to visualize the relationship
# Add a regression line

# Hint: plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg), then add abline(model)

model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
abline(model, col = "red")

```

### 🐞Debugging Task (Exercise 3)

### Fix the broken model code
```{r debug-model, exercise=TRUE}
# This code is broken. Fix the error!
lm(mpg - wt, mtcarz)

# Hint: Check the formula syntax and dataset name
lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)

```

### 🐛 Debugging with the Tested Function (Exercise 4)

### Fix the broken function call
```{r debug-model-tested, exercise=TRUE}
# This call is broken — fix the inputs so the function runs!
calc_regression_summary(mtcars, "mpg ~ wt")
```

Great work! We've fit, visualized, and debugged a linear regression model. Thinking about how R communicates errors is a key part of testing code.
